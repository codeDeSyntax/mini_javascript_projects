This theorem is significant because it guarantees that we can find a polynomial that is arbitrarily close to a given continuous function over a specific interval. This is foundational for many numerical methods that use polynomials to approximate more complex functions." }, { question: "Describe the uniqueness theorem for polynomials and its implications.", options: ["Placeholder - See answer"], answer: "The Uniqueness Theorem for Polynomials states that a polynomial of degree 'n' is uniquely determined by its values at 'n+1' distinct points. In other words, if two polynomials of degree 'n' agree at 'n+1' different points, they must be the same polynomial. This theorem has important implications for polynomial interpolation, assuring us that there is only one polynomial of a given degree that passes through a specific set of data points." }, { question: "Explain the error term associated with polynomial approximation and its relevance in numerical methods.", options: ["Placeholder - See answer"], answer: "When approximating a function using a polynomial, there is usually a difference between the true function value and the polynomial approximation at any given point. This difference is called the 'error term.' The error term is relevant in numerical methods because it helps us understand the accuracy of the approximation and provides bounds on how much the polynomial might deviate from the true function. Analyzing the error term helps us choose appropriate polynomial degrees and make informed decisions about the reliability of our numerical results." }, { question: "Describe the procedure for fitting a direct fit polynomial to a set of data points.", options: ["Placeholder - See answer"], answer: "To fit a direct fit polynomial to a set of 'n+1' data points, you typically follow these steps: 1. <b>Choose the degree:</b>  Decide on the degree 'n' of the polynomial you want to fit. This determines the number of coefficients you need to find. 2. <b>Set up a system of equations:</b> For each data point (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>), substitute the values into the general polynomial equation P(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + ... + a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>.  This creates a system of 'n+1' linear equations with 'n+1' unknown coefficients (a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>). 3. <b>Solve the system:</b> Solve the system of linear equations using methods like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion to find the coefficients. 4. <b>Form the polynomial:</b> Once you have the coefficients, substitute them back into the general polynomial equation to get the specific polynomial P(x) that fits the data." }, { question: "Data points: (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (3,4).
